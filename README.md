🛠 Building a Simple CMS with PHP & MySQL
In today’s fast-paced digital world, content is everything—but managing it shouldn't be complicated. That’s why I built a lightweight Content Management System (CMS) using core PHP, MySQL, and a touch of Bootstrap for styling. This CMS is designed with simplicity and functionality in mind, aimed at handling content from a secure admin panel.

🔧 Key Features
🛡 Secure Admin Authentication
Admins can log in securely using session-based authentication. Unauthorized access to content routes is blocked.

🗂️ CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
Easily manage articles, posts, or any other content types via a clean and minimal interface.

📁 Category-Based Organization
Content can be grouped and filtered using dynamic categories.

📄 Rich Text Support (Optional)
Textareas can be enhanced with WYSIWYG editors like TinyMCE or CKEditor for better content formatting.

📦 Tech Stack
PHP (Core, No Framework) – For server-side logic

MySQL – For data storage

Bootstrap (via CDN) – For responsive and clean UI

Sessions – For managing admin login state

💡 Why I Built This
Most modern CMS platforms are either too bloated or require frameworks. I wanted to create something lean and educational to:

Understand backend form handling and validation

Work with MySQL queries directly

Practice session management

Enable easy content updates without needing code changes
